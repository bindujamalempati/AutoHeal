# **App Name**: K8s AutoPilot

## Core Features:

- Service Deployment: Deploy microservices to a Kubernetes cluster using Docker.
- Metrics Monitoring: Continuously monitor microservice metrics (CPU, memory, latency, errors) using Prometheus.
- Alert Configuration: Configure Alertmanager to trigger alerts based on predefined rules (e.g., high CPU usage, increased error rate).
- Automated Healing: Implement a controller to receive alerts from Alertmanager, diagnose the issue, and automatically restart pods or scale replicas using the Kubernetes API.
- Visual Monitoring: Provide real-time visualization of service health and automated healing actions through Grafana dashboards.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#1A237E) for a professional and reliable feel.
- Secondary color: Light grey (#F5F5F5) for backgrounds to ensure readability.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to highlight key elements and actions.
- Clean and modern sans-serif fonts for all UI elements.
- Simple and clear icons representing different metrics and actions.
- Dashboard-style layout with clear sections for each microservice and its status.

Problem Statement ‚Üí Solution Approach ‚Üí Technology Stack ‚Üí Detailed Architecture ‚Üí Coding Strategy

üö® Problem Statement:
In modern microservice architectures, systems are made of many independent services running across containers. These services can:

Crash due to memory leaks or bugs

Suffer performance degradation (slow response times, high CPU/memory usage)

Fail intermittently due to upstream dependency issues

Traditionally, SREs or DevOps teams monitor and manually restart or redeploy the services ‚Äî which leads to:

Downtime

Delayed recovery

Frustrated users

‚ö†Ô∏è There‚Äôs a need for automatic detection and self-healing mechanisms to keep services resilient and reduce human intervention.

‚úÖ Proposed Solution: AutoHeal ‚Äì A Self-Healing Microservice Framework
Goal: Build a system that continuously monitors microservices, detects issues (crashes, high latency, resource spikes), and automatically heals the service using Kubernetes controls.

üîÅ AutoHeal: System Flow
Deploy microservices using Docker + Kubernetes.

Expose Prometheus metrics (CPU, memory, latency, errors).

Define alert rules in Prometheus (e.g., if CPU > 90% for 3 min).

AlertManager triggers an alert.

AutoHeal controller receives alert via webhook or polling.

Controller reads alert content, determines the affected pod/service.

Executes healing action:

Restart Pod

Scale replicas

Rollback deployment

Logs event and notifies via Slack/email.

(Optional) If using ML, detect anomalies using models instead of static rules.

üß† Approach of the Code (Python Example)
1. Setup Kubernetes Cluster
bash
Copy
Edit
minikube start
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml  # Your microservice definitions
2. Expose Metrics
Each microservice exposes /metrics endpoint (Flask + prometheus_client)

python
Copy
Edit
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Summary
REQUEST_TIME = Summary('request_processing_seconds', 'Time spent processing request')
3. Define Prometheus Rules
yaml
Copy
Edit
groups:
- name: service_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighCPUUsage
    expr: rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[2m]) > 0.9
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High CPU Usage Detected"
4. AutoHeal Controller (Python)
python
Copy
Edit
import requests
from kubernetes import client, config

config.load_kube_config()
v1 = client.CoreV1Api()

def restart_pod(pod_name, namespace="default"):
    v1.delete_namespaced_pod(pod_name, namespace)
    print(f"Restarted {pod_name}")

def handle_alert(alert_data):
    for alert in alert_data["alerts"]:
        if alert["labels"]["alertname"] == "HighCPUUsage":
            pod_name = extract_pod_from_alert(alert)
            restart_pod(pod_name)

def extract_pod_from_alert(alert):
    # Parse alert labels or annotations to get pod name
    return alert["labels"]["pod"]

# Flask server to receive webhook from Alertmanager
from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/alert", methods=["POST"])
def alertmanager_webhook():
    alert_data = request.json
    handle_alert(alert_data)
    return "OK", 200
üìÖ Suggested Milestone Plan (3 Weeks)
